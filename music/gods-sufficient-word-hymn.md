This new hymn tune was commissioned by my church, Community Baptist Church of Greer, SC, to celebrate their 30th anniversary as well as the 30th year of Pastor David Whitcomb’s ministry there. Chris Anderson wrote the text based on 2 Timothy 3:14-4:5, Pastor Whitcomb’s foundation passage for pastoral ministry.

> “The result of our collaboration is ‘God’s Sufficient Word,’ which unpacks teaching from 2 Timothy 3-4 (and other passages) on the inerrant, profitable, sanctifying, and sufficient Word of God. Paul climaxes his doctrine of the Scriptures in 2 Timothy 4:2, commanding Timothy and every preacher since to ‘Preach the Word.’ Praise God for Pastor Whitcomb’s faithful, conscientious ministry in which he has done that very thing.”
