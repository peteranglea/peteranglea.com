> “The traditional Latin text is treated with reverence and tenderness in this accessible accompanied setting. After a chant-like opening in the male voices, the piano sets the pace as the theme is woven into a rich choral texture.”

> “*Non Nobis* is a setting of Psalm 115:1-2, the first of *Three Latin Psalms* composed by Peter Anglea in 2011. In this beautifully reflective piece, *Non Nobis* reminds us that ‘not unto us, O Lord, but to Thy name give the glory.’ It will be successful either in a concert or worship setting.”

## Program Notes

*“Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?”* (Psalm 115:1–2). 

Many settings of the Non Nobis that I have come across, particularly those associated with the various adaptations of Henry V, are very noble and regal in nature and contain one powerful melodic line that is repeated with increasing intensity and boldness. My setting takes this idea of a recurring melodic line but with a more reverential approach. The tune is first stated a cappella by the tenors and basses in a chant-like manner. From there it is repeated, developed, interspersed with contrasting material, and eventually climaxes with 8-part divisi and soprano descant. The pieces ends as it began with a slow, chant-like statement of the tune from the tenors and basses.
