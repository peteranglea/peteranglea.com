As Christians, we often wonder what heaven will be like exactly. The occasion of a loved one passing away often causes us to speculate about what they’re experiencing in their new “home” and in their immortal bodies. This text, originally written by Laurentius Laurinus in 1622, does a great job of emphasizing heaven’s most awesome aspect – not mansions, streets of gold, or angels, but “our God, the Lord of Hosts.” He is the One Who is beyond all description, comparison, and expectation.
