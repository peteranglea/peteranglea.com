In celebration of Reformation Day 2009 and the 500th anniversary of the birth of John Calvin, I released this new hymn setting. The text is an 18th c. poem by Christian F. Gellert entitled Jesus Lives and So Shall I. I decided to put this text with a new tune, and here it is.

Feel free to use it with your congregations and let me know what you think of it. I hope you enjoy it.
