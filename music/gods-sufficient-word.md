> “A new text and tune triumphantly and joyfully celebrate the sufficiency and inerrancy of the Bible. With a singable melody and accessible part-writing, your choir will quickly master this new anthem. A wonderful and stirring challenge to respond to God’s Word with belief, submission, joy, and dependence!”
