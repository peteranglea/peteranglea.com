This new tune for Georg Neumark’s wonderful old text was commissioned by my former church, First Baptist Church of Lebanon, PA, for their pastor’s retirement. George Mackey, for whom the tune is named, retired after 45 years of full-time ministry, including 15 years at FBC. The church desired to honor him with a song based on his life verses, Proverbs 3:5-6. After some searching, this 17th century text stood out.
