> “Gentle, even youthful syncopations and soaring melodies are used in this joyful setting of the most joyful of Psalms. Only voices and piano are necessary to achieve a jubilant shout of praise in your sanctuary or concert hall.”

> <cite>J.W. Pepper</cite>

> “Piano and SATB choir unite in an enthusiastic setting of Psalm 150.  A vigorous combination of scripture and a spirited accompaniment in a fresh presentation of this well-known psalm of praise.”
