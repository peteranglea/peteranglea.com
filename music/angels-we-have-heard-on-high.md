> “From the effervescent joy of the angels’ announcement, to the wonder of the scene in Bethlehem, to the shepherds’ return to their flocks, this buoyant setting renders each carol verse in colorful music to tell a timeless story. With expressive and joyful moments, voices and piano bring the song of the angels to any concert hall or worship space.”

> “A bright new arrangement of the traditional carol. Exciting rhythmic accompaniment introduces the lively first verse and chorus which contrasts a quiet, contemplative second verse and chorus. The anthem ends with a strong, dynamic invitation to ‘come’, ‘see’ and ‘adore’ the newborn King. A great piece for Christmas Eve.”
