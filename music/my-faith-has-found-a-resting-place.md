Growing up, I sang this text (to LANDÅS) in my church a lot (perhaps too much, if that’s possible). Such is the case that after a while, even the most familiar of hymns begin to lose their significance and singing them becomes mundane. Rather than abandon it completely, in those instances, it’s helpful for me to make it my own by composing a new tune. And that’s what I’ve done here. I hope it is successful in introducing (or re-introducing) you to this rich text.

The tune name I chose is PLYMOUTH for Plymouth, New Hampshire where I spent some vacation with family and finally had time to write this out. Although there’s no connection to the more well-known Plymouth, MA (the one with the rock), if it helps you to draw a connection between a “solid rock” and your faith finding “a resting place,” that’s fine, too.
