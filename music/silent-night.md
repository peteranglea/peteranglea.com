> “If you're looking for something different from the original Silent Night, Peter Anglea’s arrangement presents a new melody while still incorporating the original STILLE NACHT in some of the accompaniment. You’re not going to want to miss this remarkable treatment of this beloved text by Joseph Mohr.”
>
> <cite>J.W. Pepper</cite>

> “A gentle, pensive new setting of the familiar carol lyrics, bringing a fresh focus on the text while incorporating a contemplative interlude constructed around the treasured original. A perfect addition to a Christmas Eve service of worship.”

## Alternate Version

In December of 2014, this piece was premiered by the Rivertree Singers of Greenville, SC. We were singing off a pre-publication score. Shortly after that, the editors at Beckenhorst and I decided to alter the third stanza to make it more accessible to a wider audience, hence the difference you see and hear in the published version.

Several choir directors have asked for this original version after seeing the YouTube video made by Rivertree (seen below). I asked Beckenhorst if they would permit me to give out the different portion of my early draft of Silent Night, and they agreed. If you feel that this version with the SATB divisi a cappella third stanza would better suit your choir, [please contact me]({% link contact.md %}) for the alternate version. You will need to purchase the complete printed piece from Beckenhorst, though.
